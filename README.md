# A.V.B.D.G.U.Y.P.D.N.T.

A.V.B.D.G.U.Y.P.D.N.T. stands for A Very Boring Dungeon Game Unless You Picked Door Number Three

A dungeon game but its not 3d nor 2d it is a text adventure or something
Your main goal is to escape a dungeon but the only way to escape the dungeon is to pick which three doors is the safest to escape or uhmmmm idk i suck at english grammars

P.S. There are Deltarune references
